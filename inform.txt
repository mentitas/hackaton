Hi! We're Gonzalo, Cielo and Florencia

First thing we did was copy the ssh private key to a local file.
Then, we ran on our terminal "ssh -i <private key path> it_consultat@13.40.34.30" and we accessed the server

With the command "scp -i <private key path> it_consultant@13.40.34.30:<server's path> <local's path> we copied "dump_2022_11_19.pcap" to our computer. 

We examined the file with Wireshark.



Â¡Flags founded!

> 1: At website > internal > index.html we found the key nujnlhrZZKidXugUkCtiUgqDMuoDbnA3. Where we found the key, the code was calling the file "login.php". At "login.php" we realized that with a certain username, we can request all the usernames and passwords.
Username: 1') OR ('1' = '1

> 2: At websites > php > login.html we found the key qL1cmCvxPS626V9MBVCL3x18LKZc4oc8. We investigated about MD5, and we found that two different passwords could have the same hash. That could be an exploit :(

> 3: At website > contact > index.html we found the key 5Mk3rXNhMC8Osgpki3iOcdVTkSAIMdxE. Where we found the key, the code was calling the file "test_comment.php". Examining the file "test_comment.php" we found a code in 64 bit format.

> 4: At pseudo-terminal > switch.py we found the key IUt0zFZKcPsLo2yek7OgSpockEd80LOA. Later on the same file, we found the flag corresponding to this key. When terminal.py calls "get_command("banner")", the get_command function calls the function "cmd_" + "banner".
