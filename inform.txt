Hi! We're Gonzalo, Cielo and Florencia

First thing we did was copy the ssh private key to a local file.
Then, we ran on our terminal "ssh -i <private key path> it_consultat@13.40.34.30" and we accessed the server

With the command "scp -i <private key path> it_consultant@13.40.34.30:<server's path> <local's path> we copied "dump_2022_11_19.pcap" to our computer. 

We examined the file with Wireshark
